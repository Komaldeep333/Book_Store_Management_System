Add Module: Add new books, authors, categories, or customer records to the system.

Update Module: Modify existing book details such as price, stock, or description.

Delete Module: Remove outdated or incorrect records from the system (e.g., books no longer in stock).

Status Module: View the current availability of books, stock levels, and order status.

Search & Filter: Quickly find books based on title, author, or category.

Sales & Billing: Record sales, generate bills, and manage transactions.
